Folder Icon Marker is a handy tool that enables you to quickly change folder icons to indicate a priority level or project status (high, low, done, half-done, planned, etc.) or you can use it to mark a folder with a special icon or color of your choice. Simply choose any folder and select the icon or color to be used from the newly added menu option. Folder Icon Marker supports single and multiple folder selections, and includes an option to restore the original icon(s).

Folder Marker allows you to choose 2 options:

#Make customized folder distributable

If the given option is chosen, the icon will be copied in the chosen directory. If you change an icon of a folder with the included option "Make customized folder distributable", you can move a folder onto another computer or save it to disk. Thus, the icon of a folder remains changed. 

If you change an icon of a folder without the checked option, the changed icon will be applicable only on your computer. On the other computer, the folder will have a standard (yellow) icon.

The inclusion of an option "Make customized folder distributable" also will leave a non-standard icon of a folder after reinstallation of the system.

#Apply selected icon to all subfolders 

The given option allows you to change an icon for all enclosed folders of the chosen directory.

Example:

After choosing folder(s), icon and setting "Apply selected icon for all subfolders" option, press "Apply". As a result, all subfolder directories will be changed.
